Using Classification models to classify crime rate and making prediction over it

I chose CRIMEDUMMY (I created), ZN, NOX, DIS, RAD, TAX, PTRATIO, LSTAT and MEDV according to "p value" analysis.
1. In Logistic Regression with Stats Model:
Accuracy 0.88, precision 0.94, recal 0.82

2. In Logistic Regression with Sklearn:
Accuracy 0.86, precision 0.94, recal 0.77

3.In KNN :
Accuracy 0.94, precision 0.94, recal 0.95

So KNN gives us a better result in this dataset.
